## Documentation

Guides, tutorials, and FAQs for installing and using Readest live in the official documentation:

📖 **[https://readest.com/docs][link-docs]**

## Building from Source

To build Readest from the latest commit, see [Getting Started](./CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started).

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Readest Won’t Launch on Windows (Missing Edge WebView2 Runtime)

**Symptom**

- When you double-click readest.exe, nothing happens. No window appears, and Task Manager does not show the process.
- This can affect both the standard installer and the portable version.

**Cause**

- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is either missing, outdated, or improperly installed on your system. Readest depends on WebView2 to render the interface on Windows.

**How to Fix**

1. Check if WebView2 is installed
   - Open “Add or Remove Programs” (a.k.a. Apps & features) on Windows. Look for “Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.”
2. Install or Update WebView2
   - Download the WebView2 Runtime directly from Microsoft: [link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?form=MA13LH).
   - If you prefer an offline installer, download the offline package and run it as an Administrator.
3. Re-run Readest
   - After installing/updating WebView2, launch readest.exe again.
   - If you still encounter problems, reboot your PC and try again.

**Additional Tips**

- If reinstalling once doesn’t work, uninstall Edge WebView2 completely, then reinstall it with Administrator privileges.
- Verify your Windows installation has the latest updates from Microsoft.

**Still Stuck?**

- See Issue [readest/readest#358](https://github.com/readest/readest/issues/358) for further details, or head over to our [Discord][link-discord] server and open a support discussion with detailed logs of your environment and the steps you’ve taken.

### 2. AppImage Launches but Only Shows a Taskbar Icon

On some Arch Linux systems—especially those using Wayland—the Readest AppImage may briefly show an icon in the taskbar and then exit without opening a window.

You might see logs such as:

```
Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER. Aborting...
```

This behavior is usually caused by compatibility issues between the bundled AppImage libraries and the system’s EGL / Wayland environment.

**Workaround 1: Launch with LD_PRELOAD (recommended)**

You can preload the system Wayland client library before launching the AppImage:

```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so /path/to/Readest.AppImage
```

This workaround has been confirmed to resolve the issue on affected systems.

**Workaround 2: Use the Flatpak Version**

If you prefer a more reliable out-of-the-box experience on Arch Linux, consider using the [Flatpak build on Flathub][link-flathub] instead. The Flatpak runtime helps avoid system library mismatches and tends to behave more consistently across different Wayland and X11 setups.
