Issue #5411: importing 8 PowerPoint-exported PDFs showed only 4 — PDF exports share
generic embedded metadata (title "PowerPoint Presentation" + same author, no
identifiers), so `importBook`'s metaHash dedupe (`md5(title|authors|identifiers)` per
format) collapsed distinct files into one entry. The metaHashMatch merge even replaces
the survivor's `hash` and deletes the old book dir, so prior imports vanish.

Fix (MERGED #5412, 2026-07-31): `getMetadataHashInfo(metadata, filename?)` appends `|filename` to
hashSource when given. `importBook` passes `getBaseFilename(filename)` for PDFs only —
EPUB dedupe stays filename-independent on purpose (identifiers are reliable there).

**Key constraint:** the original filename is LOST after import (file stored as
`{hash}/{sourceTitle}.pdf`), so the salt can never be recomputed. Both re-parse sites —
`readerStore.initViewState` and `refreshBookMetadata` — must PRESERVE `book.metaHash`
for PDFs (`if (format !== 'PDF' || !book.metaHash) recompute`). Any new code that
recomputes metaHash from a parsed bookDoc must do the same or PDF hashes flip-flop.

Empty-title PDFs were never affected: title falls back to base filename at import, so
the filename was already in the hash. SyncInfoDialog is safe (prefers storedMetaHash).
koplugin/Rust never compute metaHash — only read it from sync rows.
